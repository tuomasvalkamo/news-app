## Project description

* Mobile application for reading Hacker News by Y Combinator
* Made with React Native using Expo
* Project assignment for Mobile Programming course, Business Information Technology degree programme at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, in autumn of 2021

## User interface & functionality

The application consists of four different views. Below I have showcased three of them. (Captured on Android, from left to right):

1. **Top stories tab:** Todays most upvoted stories from Hacker News. You can also search stories by title keyword or by site url.
2. **Bookmarks:** Your saved bookmarks. You can bookmark any article you find to add it here.
3. **Web browser tab:** Any article you click will be opened here. You can hop between different tabs and your article won't go anywhere.
